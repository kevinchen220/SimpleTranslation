# SimpleTranslator

## What it does
The program is basically a simplified google translate with only voice inputs. \
First, it takes in the language the user speaks as the display language. \
It then asks for what language the user wants to translate. \
Then, what language they want to translate to. \
Finally, it asks for the content to translate and outputs the translated content.

## How I built it
    - python
    - google-speech-recognition
    - gTTS (google text to speech)
    - TextBlob
The language I used to build this project was python. I used google-speech-recognition to recognize speech to text. I used gTTS for text to speech. I used TextBlob for the translation of texts.
